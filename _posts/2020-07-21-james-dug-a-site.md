I've always had a deep appreciation for people who maintain tech blogs, those who take the time to document their learned experience for public consumption. I have benefited a lot from others hard work. 

I've never wanted to be indebted to maintaining a complex site like WordPress, and I would never feel satisfied using a turn-key blog solution. 

Jekyll looks like it will strike a great balance. It has unique complexities and almost zero maintenance. Using Github and Markdown makes development very portable.

I am starting this site with three main goals, spend more time coding, create and share tools and processes for MacAdmins and share my experience learning Russian. 

PS: My first real post is about developing my website ~ 10 points for originality.
