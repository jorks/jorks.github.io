If you've found your way here it's probably because of all the Google keywords hidden in the same colour as the background. Select all is Command + A. Sucker ;-) At least I have your attention.


My passion is enabling people to do their best work through technology - while I get to *nerd out* along the way.

While my focus is Apple in the enterprise, I have first-hand experience and a deep understanding of enterprise architecture and technologies - Windows, Azure, Identity, Network & Security.

I currently have the pleasure of applying my experience at Jamf, helping our key enterprise customers succeed with Apple.

Interrupting my Zooms you can expect to see my lovely wife Sasha with our darling 👼 daughter Billie, our cat Sugar and if something terrible has happened - one of our fish 🐠.

printf(“Peace, out!”);
