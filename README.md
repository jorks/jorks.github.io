**Hot Tip** üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Click the StarWars quote in the footer.

## Notes to myself (for when I break things)
### Customised Files

I have customised the following file that may break updates:

- `_includes/footer.html` including the Star Wars script I wrote.
- `_sass/minimal-mistakes/skins/_jorks.scss`
- `assets/css/main.scss` Some custom CSS

## Catagories

I am not using categories for posts at present. This may change for guides. Categories provide uri prefixes. 
Example: Use the category Music to add /music/post to the uri.
